# Motorcycle/routing
Routing calculations for 3 types of motorcycle use, each of these routings calculates a route based on the information available in OpenStreetMap.
<br>

see here **[for the installation](https://github.com/OsmAnd-Rendering/Motorcycle/blob/main/installation_EN.md)**

## heavy trailbike 
<b>will take you ONLY on the easy tracks (the brown ones) and if he can't find any, on the road and very small bits of some green tracks.</b>
<br>
- respect the prohibitions (**red tracks** on the map)
- respect the barriers (**red dots** on the map)
- the "**private**" tracks are managed as with the default profile of OsmAnd.
- the "**forbidden**" tracks are grouped under the switch "<b>pas d'interdiction</b>" in "<b>Avoid roads</b>".
- :bulb: there is another switch in "<b>Avoid roads</b>" to activate a mode "<b>si chemins secs</b>" which adds some "**green**" tracks to the map in case there are no "**brown**" tracks nearby.<br> :warning: Beware of mud with unsuitable tires!
- :bulb: there is another switch in "<b>Avoid roads</b>" to activate a "<b>pas de chemins</b>" mode which avoids tracks as much as possible by staying on the roads as small as possible.
- the roads are hierarchical, allowing you to move faster over long distances without tracks.

<i>(put intermediate points to "force" the detour by the "good" tracks if there are none in direct line).</i>
<br>

## light trailbike
<b>will make you avoid paths and footways but will take all tracks except those indicated "impassable".</b>
<br>
- respect the prohibitions (**red tracks** on the map)
- respect the barriers (**red dots** on the map)
- the "**private**" tracks are managed as with the default profile of OsmAnd.
- the "**forbidden**" tracks are grouped under the switch "<b>pas d'interdiction</b>" in "<b>Avoid roads</b>".
- favors hiking and mountain bike routes over roads.
- Considers all tracks the same (no drivable or muddy) <br>:bulb: <b>except</b> if the switch "<b>trie les chemins</b>" in "<b>Avoid roads</b>" is active (checked) it will prioritize the tracks from most drivable to unknown.
<i><br>
in fact it will penalize more and more the tracks which are the least practicable <br>
to go from a point A to a point B if 2 tracks approximately equivalent in distance exist, the engine of calculation of routing will take the most practicable, the proportion of road increases if the tracks are not informed in OpenStreetMap</i>
- considers all routes at the same level and therefore will plot the most direct.

<i>( do not put points too far away to speed up the calculation - every 100 km for example )</i>
 
## enduro bike
<b>will make you pass everywhere except stairs and bike paths and of course the black spots (impassable ^^).</b><br>
- all switches are inactive (everything is active, fords, frozen roads, private access etc)
- respects the "no" and "private" prohibitions <b>except</b> if the switch "<b>Pas d'interdit</b>" is active.
- respect absolute barriers (chain, gate etc)
- lower priority for red dots on the map which will be avoided if alternative.
- consider footways as paths (many paths are wrongly marked as footways)
- favors marked routes (hiking and mountain biking)
- slightly favors paths over tracks.
- All the roads are at the same level, he traces the most direct.

<i>( do not put points too far away to speed up the calculation -every 100 km for example )</i><br>
on my phone a calculation between 2 points about 200 km apart takes 2 minutes.<br>
 
## Calculation
If you find the calculation too slow or you can't calculate a route<br>
- go to "<b>configure profile</b>"
- then "<b>guidance settings.</b>"
- "<b>Vehicle Features.</b>"
- "<b>default speed.</b>"

and lower the max speed to <b>90 km/h</b> (or less if needed)<br>
know that the more you lower it, the faster the calculation but the more roads it prints.<br>
(don't ban highways or tolls, they are already disabled)
 
## Examples
When you calculate a route you will have access to information about your route<br>
proportion road / tracks (and paths for "enduro")<br>
type of tracks with the colors corresponding to those of the map with the applied style.<br>

Here is an example in my region (South West of France) (about 100 km as the crow flies ).<br>

with "<b>gros trail</b>" routing without active options :

with "<b>gros trail</b>" routing and switch "<b>si chemins secs</b>" active :<br>
which adds less passable "green" tracks in a small proportion.<br>
(note that the proportion of road is decreasing)

with "<b>petit_trail</b>" routing and switch "<b>trie les chemins</b>" active:<br>
the results are often very close to the "<b>gros_trail</b>" with "<b>si chemins secs</b>" Active when paths are populated in <b>OpenStreetMap.</b><br>
(but the type of "green" paths changes by being less "passable")
in the case where the majority of the tracks are not specified, the "sorting" of the tracks imposes more roads instead of "difficult" tracks.<br>

with "<b>petit_trail</b>" routing without the switch "<b>trie les chemins</b>" active:<br>
the proportion of roads continues to decrease, the tracks not populated in **OpenStreetMap** become more important, until representing the majority of the tracks according to the regions more or less populated in osm.<br>

"<b>enduro</b>" in red the paths.

well ... don't forget that it is perfectible and that in the best case it is based on the information added in OpenStreetMap which may be obsolete (recently destroyed tracks) or based on a subjective impression of the person who filled it in (level of difficulty for example).
